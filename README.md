This bot is made for the ChromoCraft server. Chromocraft is a small to medium size whitelisted minecraft server.

Chromo-Bot is a custom bot specifily meant for the server. We has all kinds of commands perfect for the server.
Along the way of programming the bot, I thought it would be great for me to have my own module and publish it on GitHub and npm.

The link to the module can be found below:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dominic_mine/dom-module

Regex for making per line .json array:

Find: (.+)
Replace: "$1",

Regex for removing empty lines:

Find: ^(\s)*$\n
Replace: Put nothing.

This bot was programmed using:
  discord.js; a javascript interface to the Discord API
  
  Visual Studio Code; the text editor/IDE used to program the code
  
  I hope this code will help you in understanding how people code their discord bots.
