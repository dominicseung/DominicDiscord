A custom module made by Dominic Seung, used in node.js. This module was meant for storing functions.


Importing the module: const dom = require('@dominic_mine/dom-module');

dom.throttle(function, delay):
    Keep the spamming of a function. You set the a function to run, then set the delay in milliseconds.

dom.countdown(date):

    This function uses the new Date() and Date.parse()

    .totaltime => Displays the total time in a human readable string

    Keep in mind that the options below will be one off, due to how time works

    .milliseconds => Displays the time in milliseconds
    .days => Displays the time in days
    .hours => Displays the time in hours
	.minutes => Displays the time in minutes
    .seconds => Displays the time in seconds


How versions work:

    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
        MAJOR version: Incompatible API changes or a huge leap forward
        MINOR version: Functionality in a backwards-compatible manner or cleaned code/syntax
        PATCH version: Backwards-compatible bug fixes or very small changes

    Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
